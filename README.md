# Bluetooth_ECG-EEG
This project is a desktop-based biomedical monitoring system that visualizes, processes, and exports 
real-time ECG and EEG signals via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) integration. While the final BLE 
connectivity will be integrated in hardware testing, the current application supports fully simulated 
signal streams, advanced signal processing, secure encrypted data storage, and multi-format export 
options (CSV, JSON, EDF).
